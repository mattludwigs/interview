## CAH Interview

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you will choose to accept it),
is to fork this repository and build a simple todo list using React components.

Feel free to create new components or modify what is already defined. You may
include any `npm` packages you desire; however, **you may not use jQuery**.

### Getting Started

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `http://localhost:8080`
  - If necessary, you can change the port in `webpack.config.js`

### Requirements

At minimum, a user should be able to add items (using a text input) and remove
individual items (Font Awesome is included in this project bootstrap if you
want to use an icon!).

Don't worry about styling or saving data to a back-end; it's okay if all of the
list items disappear between page reloads.

**Extra credit:** feel free to add any other functionality you want (styling,
 saving the list to local storage, etc.).
